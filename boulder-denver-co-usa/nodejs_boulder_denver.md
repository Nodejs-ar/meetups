## Formats

### Presentations, Demos, and Social

Node.js Boulder/Denver will be holding monthly meetups in both Boulder and Denver.
They will usually include a presentation followed by the chance for anybody to demo what they are building with node.js. After the presentations and demos, it's open to social interaction; a chance for people to provide or receive help with their projects or talk about the latest Hacker Newshot drama.

Pizza and drinks are provided so come hungry and thirsty.

### Hack Nights

We are looking to setup some hack nights for those wanting to collaborate, share their 
projects, or just come out and hack on Node.js.

## Process

There are some great local developers working with node.js that love to share
what they have going on. They present both their personal and professional
projects to give you an idea of what problems they are solving with node.js.

The organizers facilitate the speakers, the venue, and the food -- feedback can
be sent directly to them either on Twitter or in person.
