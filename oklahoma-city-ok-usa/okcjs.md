## Formats

### Lunch Talks

Talks are held on the third Tuesday of every month. Our presentations vary from one talk (35-45 minutes), two talks (25-35 minutes), and lightning talks once every quarter (5-10 minutes).
Questions are encouraged; all skill levels and skill sets are welcome.
We strive to provide our community with a safe and friendly environment, conductive to learning, fellowship, and friendship.

### Eat and Drink

Our sponsors provide sodas and pizza or tacos each month.

### Becoming a Speaker

We accept talk proposals through [email](mailto:oklahomacityjavascript@gmail.com), [twitter](https://twitter.com/okcjs), or you can talk to us in person.

### Thunder Plains JS Conference

Our community driven [Thunder Plains JavaScript Conference](http://thunderplainsconf.com) is held yearly in Oklahoma City, OK.
We invite all speakers to submit proposals during our Call For Speakers.
Thunder Plains covers JavaScript libraries, frameworks, CSS preprocessors, postprocessors, architecture, testing, game development,
all things open source, and emerging technology.

## Process

Talks submitted to OKCjs are chosen based on relevancy to JavaScript.
We notify speakers once their talk has been accepted.
We offer our time to listen to presentations, review slides, and give feedback to all speakers.

Presentations submitted to Thunder Plains are chosen via a double blind process, chosen by the talk's relevancy and radness.
After organizers deliberate over the talks, the submitters are notified of their acceptance status.
We aim to offer constructive feedback, sincere thanks, and high fives for excellence to all submitters.
